A collection of my config files. Tested (to various degrees) on OS X, Arch
Linux, and Ubuntu.

## Installation

I like to keep all my repos in a `~/workspace` directory, so I'll assume the
same for you.

```bash
# The only requirement is git and python3, so make sure those are available
mkdir -p  ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/philipforget/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/setup.py
```
